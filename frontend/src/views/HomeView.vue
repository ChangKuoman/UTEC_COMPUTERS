                        Our project is a web application that allows the simulated purchase
                        of a computer taking into account the motherboard as the base piece
                        and its compatibility with the different components. The information
                        in the database is based on different web pages for the purchase of
                        specialized technology in computers such as LoginStore, and proprietary
                        brands such as MSI, AMD, Intel, among others. It is made with the Flask
                        micro Framework for the backend and the Vue Framework for the frontend.
